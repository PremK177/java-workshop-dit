Q. Print the array elements where have to print 10 to 800 by using 1-D array

# OOPs concepts in Java (Orientation of interview)

- There are five primary OOPs concepts (Wipro, TCS)
    1. Class
    2. Object
    3. Abstraction
    4. Inheritance
    5. Polymorphism

1. Class - class is defined as a blueprint of objects for real-world entities
2. Object - objects are defined as instances of class in run-time algorithm

Example of class: house is a class, room size/room color/room no./no. of floor/room structure/design/etc. which describe
the feature or the properties of instances to the class behavior

Syntax of class: 
```
class ClassName {
    variable declaration;
    method declaration;
}
```
(Variable/data members can be object or not? **Yes**)

```
void/int functionName (argument list);
```

Inheritance: is the process of transmitting the properties and behavior from parent class to the child class.

- Base class: is also known as parent class or main class.
- Child class: is also known as derived class or sub class.

Types of inheritance:
1. Single inheritance: one parent class and one child class.
2. Multiple inheritance: one parent class is transmitted all the properties and behavior to its multiple child classes
3. Multi-level inheritance: is defined as the properites and behavior of one parent class to the child class, that child
class is inherited to a further child class
4. Hierarchical inheritance: the properties and behavior of multiple parent/base classes inherit/transmit to its single
child class

A person is a parent class whose inherit different multiple positions (real world living positions)

Polymorphism:
