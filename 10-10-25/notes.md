Q. create a class car in which define speed, price, model no, weight, brand and color. Display for seven cars in the 
main method

Polymorphism: means many shapes, forms, characters, sizes for one entity

Types of polymorphism:
1. run-time polymorphism
2. compile-time polymorphism

run-time polymorphism: 
- is also known as dynamic binding 
- it is achieved by method overriding

compile-time polymorphism: 
- is a static binding
- is achieved by method overloading

Method overloading: is defined as when two or more with same name method but different parameters call in main method
of java

Types of method overloading:
1. function overloading - when two or more functions with same name but different parameters to perform overloading
2. operator overloading - when two or more operators with same name but different unary binary operator parameters 
3. constructor overloading - when two or more constructors with same name but different parameters to initialize objects
    in main method

Constructor can be a method or not? **yes**

Constructor: is a method to initialize object automatically

There are four types of constructor:
1. parameterized constructor - parameter value is included
2. non-parameterized constructor/default - no parameter value/system default value
3. default constructor
4. copy constructor

function: is defined as block of code of big programs divided into small-small units that unit is known as function

Types of function:
1. pre-defined function - `System.out.println();`, `Scanner.next();`
2. user defined function
3. library function
