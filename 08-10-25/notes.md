Array is defined as collections of similar data type elements in definite size

Syntax of array: `data_type arr_name[size];`

[] - subscript operator

Second way to initialize array: `data_type arr_name[size] = {value1, value2, value3, ...};`

Advantages of array:
1. ease of traversing (Interview question IQ100)
2. ease of sorting
3. random access
4. ease of positioning

- Traversing is a method to visit each element from the array one-by-one linearly till the target element is found
- sorting is a process to add or delete elements from tree-node or post-node
- Indexing: is a method to access any particular (target) element from the array
- Position: is a method to access any particular element from the array

How to access any element through position method
- position is always start from 1

disadvantages of array
- fixed size (each element occupies the fixed size as per that particular data type)

Rules for solving any question of array
1. when solving array question, use one for loop to read the elements of an array
2. use one more for loop to print that required outcome elements
